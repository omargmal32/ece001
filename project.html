touching or direct deposition. </pre></p>

 <h5 style="text-align: center;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 30;">How Computer science can help COVID-19 </h5>
 <pre>
     <h6 style="font-size: 22;">In this moment we should ask how engineering cauld do an effiective role in COVID-19
    </h6>
<p style="font-size: 16;">The COVID-19 pandemic has mobilized the worldâ€™s scientific community like no other recent crisis, including many researchers using the most 
   modern data science and artificial intelligence approaches. At the University of Chicago, public health experts, computer scientists, 
   economists and policy analysts have launched projects using computational tools to better detect, diagnose, treat and prevent the spread 
   of the deadly virus.

    This summer, three of these projects received seed funding from theC3.ai Digital Transformation Institute (DTI)", a new partnership 
of technology companies and universities committed to accelerating the benefits of artificial intelligence for business, government and 
society. The research attacks the pandemic from several angles: helping policymakers control disease spread by identifying and addressing 
key social factors, physicians detect the disease at earlier stages, and hospitals decide which patients require admission.</p>

 <h7 style="font-size: 22;">  what about World Health Organization</h7>
 <p>world health organization said that :-

    Fact1: You can recover from illness caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19). Being infected with the new corona virus does not mean that
     you will be infected with the virus forever. Most people who get COVID-19 recover completely and get rid of the virus from their bodies. 
     If you do get sick, be sure to treat your symptoms. If you have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention early, 
     but phone the health care facility first. Most patients recover with supportive care.
    
    fact2:-The COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas where the climate is hot and humid From the evidence available so far, the COVID-19 
    virus can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather. Whatever the climate, take precautions if you live in 
    or intend to travel to an area where COVID-19 infection has been reported. Perhaps the best way to protect yourself from contracting 
    COVID-19 is to wash your hands regularly. By doing this, you can get rid of viruses that may be stuck on your hands and thus avoid possible 
    infection if you touch your eyes, mouth or nose.</p>
    <p>ICT information technologies proved to be very helpful in improving big data collection processes and analytics in various fields of social
sciences, medical, economic, etc. ICT, Internet and Industry 4.0 information technologies helped to reduce the negative impact of the 
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic ( Covid-19) on societies, economy, health care institutions, etc. These technologies have made it possible 
to increase the scale of digitization and Internetisation of remote communication processes as well as social, economic and other processes. 
Thanks to the implementation of ICT, Internet and Industry 4.0 information technologies to remote communication processes, economic processes 
and the improvement of analytical processes implemented in various scientific disciplines, many institutions and economic entities have managed 
to significantly reduce the negative effects of the Coronavirus pandemic. Thanks to the aforementioned technologies, the scale of the health, economic,
social, etc. crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus pandemic is much smaller than it would be if these technologies did not exist. Therefore,
the current fourth technological revolution has proved to be very helpful in reducing the negative impact of the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus pandemic on 
the functioning of people, the operation of public institutions, economic entities and entire economies. If this type of pandemic appeared, for example, in 
the middle of the 20th century, i.e. before the development of computer science and the third technological revolution, then the negative impact of the 
SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus pandemic on people and entire economies would be several times higher than that recorded in 2020.</p>
